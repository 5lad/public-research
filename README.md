  - [Momentum Has Its Moments](http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~psc/MomentumMoments.pdf)
  ```
  Compared with the market, value, or size factors, momentum has offered investors the
  highest Sharpe ratio. However, momentum has also had the worst crashes, making the
  strategy unappealing to investors who dislike negative skewness and kurtosis. We find
  that the risk of momentum is highly variable over time and predictable. Managing this
  risk virtually eliminates crashes and nearly doubles the Sharpe ratio of the momentum
  strategy. Risk-managed momentum is a much greater puzzle than the original version.
